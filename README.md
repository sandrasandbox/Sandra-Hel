# Sandra-Hel
Greetings, I'm Sandra ˆ⌣ˆ, an Industrial Engineer. 
Currently, I'm working as a data analyst at one of the FMCG companies in Indonesia.
I enjoy self-study to enhance my skills.
At present, I'm learning how to use Python for data processing and visualization.
In the future, I aspire to become a data scientist, then explore AI and potentially become an AI engineer.
